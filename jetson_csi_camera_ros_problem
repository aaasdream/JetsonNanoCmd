Finally, I modified file /opt/ros/indigo/share/cv_bridge/cmake/cv_bridgeConfig.cmake

I changed

set(cv_bridge_FOUND_CATKIN_PROJECT TRUE)

if(NOT "include;/usr/include/opencv;/usr/include " STREQUAL " ")
  set(cv_bridge_INCLUDE_DIRS "")
  set(_include_dirs "include;/usr/include/opencv;/usr/include")
to

set(cv_bridge_FOUND_CATKIN_PROJECT TRUE)
if(NOT "include;/usr/local/include/opencv" STREQUAL " ")
  set(cv_bridge_INCLUDE_DIRS "")
  set(_include_dirs "/usr/local/include/opencv;/usr/include;/usr/local/include")
In fact I just changed usr/include to /usr/local/include. This solved my problem. But I do not think it the correct way to do (?).
